**Option Pricing Model — Python Foundations & Analysis**

This repository documents a step-by-step learning and implementation journey toward building an Option Pricing Model using Python.
The work is structured into two weeks, progressing from core Python skills to data analysis, visualization, and regression modeling, which together form the foundation for option pricing techniques such as Black–Scholes and empirical pricing models.

**Week 1 — Python Foundations**

Week 1 focuses on building strong core Python skills, essential for implementing financial models cleanly and accurately.

**Covered Topics:**
Conditional logic and control flow
Loops and iteration
Functions and modular code
Lists, strings, dictionaries
Basic pandas usage for structured data

 Notebooks
1. Function Practice Exercises-
Custom function creation
Logical problem solving
Input–output validation
Financial relevance: reusable payoff and utility functions

2. Guessing Game Challenge-
Loop control and state tracking
User input handling
Logical flow control
Financial relevance: simulation-style thinking

3. Pandas SF Salaries Exercise-
DataFrame exploration
Grouping and aggregation
Handling missing data

Financial relevance: structured financial datasets

4. Python Statements Assessment Test-
For-loops and while-loops
List comprehensions
Conditional branching
Clean and efficient Python syntax

**Week 2 — Data Analysis & Modeling**

Week 2 builds directly on Week 1 by applying Python skills to data visualization and statistical modeling, key steps toward option pricing.

**Covered Topics**
Data visualization with Matplotlib
Trend analysis and relationships
Linear regression modeling
Interpretation of coefficients and fit

 Notebooks
5. Matplotlib Exercises-
Line plots, scatter plots, histograms
Subplots and figure control
Visual analysis of distributions and trends

6. Linear Regression Project-
Data preparation and feature selection
Model fitting using regression
Interpretation of slope, intercept, and R²
